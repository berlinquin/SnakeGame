# Status

I got to everything except adjusting the size of the game board.
This would take some more time to implement, since with my current design
the Board class is pretty tightly coupled to the AsyncEngine class.
These classes would need to get cleaned up further before implementing resizing.

# Usage

Running the script main.py will start a simple driver for the engine.
It allows you to control the direction of the snake, and to pause and restart the game.

For convenience, the game engine also prints out a representation of
the board with each movement of the snake.
This would be unnecessary with a more sophisticated driver that
could switch between querying for input from the user and
querying the game engine for an updated state.

The high score is saved to a file called high_score.txt.
